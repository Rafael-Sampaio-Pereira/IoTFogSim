Random Walk Model
As a variant of RWP, RW is also an important random mobility model. The node in RW randomly selects
a direction from [0, 2Ï€], from [Vmin, Vmax] Randomly select a speed, and then move to a new 
position according to the selected direction and speed. In the process of node movement, select a 
time interval t or a fixed distance d. When the node moves for t time or d length, reselect the 
direction and speed of the node.
